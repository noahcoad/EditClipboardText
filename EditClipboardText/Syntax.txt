EditClipboardText takes the text in the clipboard, saves it
to a temp file, and opens the file in your favorite text editor

Syntax: EditClipboardText [/editor <file>]

Where <file> is the full path and file name to the editor to
be used, otherwise the environment variable "edit" is used,
if still no editor is found, Notepad.exe is used
